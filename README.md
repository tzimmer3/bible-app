# bible-app
Application for semantic search of bible text.


Currently abstracted to the Chapter level.


Will want a way to switch to any level of abstraction [chapter, verse, other]


Add in a cross encoder to improve results


How to best handle performance?  Compute embeddings each time, store embeddings somehow, etc.
