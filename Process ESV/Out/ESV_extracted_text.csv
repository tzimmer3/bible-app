ESV Bible.pdf,"The Word Became Flesh
1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was in
the beginning with God. 3All things were made
through him, and without him was not any thing made
that was made. 4In him was life,[1] and the life was
the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness,
and the darkness has not overcome it.
6There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John. 7He came as a witness, to bear witness about
the light, that all might believe through him. 8He was
not the light, but came to bear witness about the
light.
9The true light, which enlightens everyone, was
coming into the world. 10He was in the world, and the
world was made through him, yet the world did not
know him. 11He came to his own,[2] and his own
people[3] did not receive him. 12But to all who did
receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the",4998
ESV Bible.pdf,"right to become children of God, 13who were born,
not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of
man, but of God.
14And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,
and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son
from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15(John bore
witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of
whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before
me, because he was before me.’”) 16And from his
fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.
17For the law was given through Moses; grace and
truth came through Jesus Christ. 18No one has ever
seen God; the only God,[4] who is at the Father's
side,[5] he has made him known.",4999
ESV Bible.pdf,"The Testimony of John the Baptist
19And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews
sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,
“Who are you?” 20He confessed, and did not deny,
but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” 21And they
asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I
am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered,
“No.” 22So they said to him, “Who are you? We need
to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you
say about yourself?” 23He said, “I am the voice of
one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight[6] the
way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
24(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
25They asked him, “Then why are you baptizing, if
you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the
Prophet?” 26John answered them, “I baptize with
water, but among you stands one you do not know,
27even he who comes after me, the strap of whose
sandal I am not worthy to untie.” 28These things took
place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was",5000

and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes
away the sin of the world! 30This is he of whom I
said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me,
because he was before me.’ 31I myself did not know
him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water,
that he might be revealed to Israel.” 32And John bore
witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a
dove, and it remained on him. 33I myself did not
know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water
said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend
and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy
Spirit.’ 34And I have seen and have borne witness
that this is the Son of God.”",5002

35The next day again John was standing with two of
his disciples, 36and he looked at Jesus as he
walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”

followed Jesus. 38Jesus turned and saw them
following and said to them, “What are you seeking?”
And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means
Teacher), “where are you staying?” 39He said to
them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and
saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him
that day, for it was about the tenth hour.[7] 40One of
the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus[8]
was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41He first found
his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have
found the Messiah” (which means Christ). 42He
brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said,
“So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be
called Cephas” (which means Peter[9]).",5003

43The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He
found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” 44Now
Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and
Peter. 45Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We
have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also
the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph.” 46Nathanael said to him, “Can anything
good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him,
“Come and see.” 47Jesus saw Nathanael coming
toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite
indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” 48Nathanael
said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus
answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you
were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49Nathanael
answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You
are the King of Israel!” 50Jesus answered him,
“Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’
do you believe? You will see greater things than
these.” 51And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to
you,[10] you will see heaven opened, and the angels",5004

2:1 On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in
Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2Jesus
also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.
3When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to
him, “They have no wine.” 4And Jesus said to her,
“Woman, what does this have to do with me? My
hour has not yet come.” 5His mother said to the
servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
6Now there were six stone water jars there for the
Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or
thirty gallons.[11] 7Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the
jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.
8And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take
it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. 9When
the master of the feast tasted the water now become
wine, and did not know where it came from (though
the servants who had drawn the water knew), the
master of the feast called the bridegroom 10and said
to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and",5006

But you have kept the good wine until now.” 11This,

who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and

whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple,
with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the
coins of the money-changers and overturned their
tables. 16And he told those who sold the pigeons,
“Take these things away; do not make my Father's
house a house of trade.” 17His disciples
remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house
will consume me.”
18So the Jews said to him, “What sign do you show
us for doing these things?” 19Jesus answered them,
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.” 20The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six
years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in
three days?” 21But he was speaking about the

3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2This man came to
Jesus[13] by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know
that you are a teacher come from God, for no one
can do these signs that you do unless God is with
him.” 3Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you,
unless one is born again[14] he cannot see the
kingdom of God.” 4Nicodemus said to him, “How
can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a
second time into his mother's womb and be born?”
5Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless
one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter
the kingdom of God. 6That which is born of the flesh
is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit.[15] 7Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You[16]

his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in
order that the world might be saved through him.
18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but
whoever does not believe is condemned already,
because he has not believed in the name of the only
Son of God. 19And this is the judgment: the light has
come into the world, and people loved the darkness
rather than the light because their works were evil.
20For everyone who does wicked things hates the
light and does not come to the light, lest his works
should be exposed. 21But whoever does what is true
comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that

22After this Jesus and his disciples went into the
Judean countryside, and he remained there with
them and was baptizing. 23John also was baptizing
at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful
there, and people were coming and being baptized
24(for John had not yet been put in prison).
25Now a discussion arose between some of John's
disciples and a Jew over purification. 26And they
came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was
with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore
witness—look, he is baptizing, and all are going to
him.” 27John answered, “A person cannot receive
even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.

not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.’

ESV Bible.pdf,"Jesus and the Woman of Samaria
4:1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had
heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John 2(although Jesus himself did not
baptize, but only his disciples), 3he left Judea and
departed again for Galilee. 4And he had to pass
through Samaria. 5So he came to a town of Samaria
called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to
his son Joseph. 6Jacob's well was there; so Jesus,
wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting
beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.[23]
7A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus
said to her, “Give me a drink.” 8(For his disciples
had gone away into the city to buy food.) 9The
Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a
Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?”
(For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
10Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God,
and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’
you would have asked him, and he would have given",5016
ESV Bible.pdf,"you living water.” 11The woman said to him, “Sir, you
have nothing to draw water with, and the well is
deep. Where do you get that living water? 12Are you
greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well
and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his
livestock.” 13Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks
of this water will be thirsty again, 14but whoever
drinks of the water that I will give him will never be
thirsty again.[24] The water that I will give him will
become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal
life.” 15The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this
water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come
here to draw water.”
16Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and
come here.” 17The woman answered him, “I have no
husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying,
‘I have no husband’; 18for you have had five
husbands, and the one you now have is not your
husband. What you have said is true.” 19The woman
said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
20Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you",5017
ESV Bible.pdf,"say that in Jerusalem is the place where people
ought to worship.” 21Jesus said to her, “Woman,
believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this
mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the
Father. 22You worship what you do not know; we
worship what we know, for salvation is from the
Jews. 23But the hour is coming, and is now here,
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in
spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people
to worship him. 24God is spirit, and those who
worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 25The
woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming
(he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell
us all things.” 26Jesus said to her, “I who speak to
you am he.”
27Just then his disciples came back. They marveled
that he was talking with a woman, but no one said,
“What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with
her?” 28So the woman left her water jar and went
away into town and said to the people, 29“Come,
see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be",5018
ESV Bible.pdf,"the Christ?” 30They went out of the town and were
coming to him.
31Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying,
“Rabbi, eat.” 32But he said to them, “I have food to
eat that you do not know about.” 33So the disciples
said to one another, “Has anyone brought him
something to eat?” 34Jesus said to them, “My food is
to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish
his work. 35Do you not say, ‘There are yet four
months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift
up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for
harvest. 36Already the one who reaps is receiving
wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that
sower and reaper may rejoice together. 37For here
the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’
38I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor.
Others have labored, and you have entered into their
labor.”
39Many Samaritans from that town believed in him
because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all",5019
ESV Bible.pdf,"that I ever did.” 40So when the Samaritans came to
him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed
there two days. 41And many more believed because
of his word. 42They said to the woman, “It is no
longer because of what you said that we believe, for
we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this
is indeed the Savior of the world.”
43After the two days he departed for Galilee. 44(For
Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no
honor in his own hometown.) 45So when he came to
Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all
that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they

heal his son, for he was at the point of death. 48So
Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and
wonders you will not believe.” 49The official said to
him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” 50Jesus
said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man
believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went

met him and told him that his son was recovering.

better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the

2Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a
pool, in Aramaic[27] called Bethesda,[28] which has
five roofed colonnades. 3In these lay a multitude of
invalids—blind, lame, and paralyzed.[29] 5One man
was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight
years. 6When Jesus saw him lying there and knew
that he had already been there a long time, he said
to him, “Do you want to be healed?” 7The sick man
answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the
pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am
going another steps down before me.” 8Jesus said
to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.” 9And at
once the man was healed, and he took up his bed
and walked.
Now that day was the Sabbath. 10So the Jews said
to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath,",5023

he answered them, “The man who healed me, that
man said to me, ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’”

‘Take up your bed and walk’?” 13Now the man who
had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus
had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.
14Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said
to him, “See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing
worse may happen to you.” 15The man went away
and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed
him. 16And this was why the Jews were persecuting

“This is the work of God, that you believe in him
whom he has sent.” 30So they said to him, “Then
what sign do you do, that we may see and believe
you? What work do you perform? 31Our fathers ate
the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He
gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32Jesus then
said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not
Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my
Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 33For
the bread of God is he who comes down from
heaven and gives life to the world.” 34They said to
him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”
35Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life;
whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever
believes in me shall never thirst. 36But I said to you
that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 37All
that the Father gives me will come to me, and
whoever comes to me I will never cast out. 38For I
have come down from heaven, not to do my own will
but the will of him who sent me. 39And this is the will",5034
ESV Bible.pdf,"of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all
that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.
40For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who
looks on the Son and believes in him should have
eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”
41So the Jews grumbled about him, because he
said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”
42They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
whose father and mother we know? How does he
now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43Jesus
answered them, “Do not grumble among yourselves.
44No one can come to me unless the Father who
sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last
day. 45It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all
be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and
learned from the Father comes to me— 46not that
anyone has seen the Father except he who is from
God; he has seen the Father. 47Truly, truly, I say to
you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48I am the
bread of life. 49Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died. 50This is the bread that",5035
ESV Bible.pdf,"comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it
and not die. 51I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live
forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the
world is my flesh.”
52The Jews then disputed among themselves,
saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
53So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
his blood, you have no life in you. 54Whoever feeds
on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and
I will raise him up on the last day. 55For my flesh is
true food, and my blood is true drink. 56Whoever
feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me,
and I in him. 57As the living Father sent me, and I live
because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he
also will live because of me. 58This is the bread that
came down from heaven, not like the bread[33] the
fathers ate and died. Whoever feeds on this bread
will live forever.” 59Jesus[34] said these things in the
synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.",5036

ESV Bible.pdf,"The Words of Eternal Life
60When many of his disciples heard it, they said,
“This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” 61But
Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were
grumbling about this, said to them, “Do you take
offense at this? 62Then what if you were to see the
Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63It
is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all.
The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
life. 64But there are some of you who do not believe.”
(For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were
who did not believe, and who it was who would
betray him.) 65And he said, “This is why I told you
that no one can come to me unless it is granted him
by the Father.”
66After this many of his disciples turned back and no
longer walked with him. 67So Jesus said to the
Twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” 68Simon
Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go?
You have the words of eternal life, 69and we have",5038

Holy One of God.” 70Jesus answered them, “Did I not
choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a
devil.” 71He spoke of Judas the son of Simon
Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to
betray him.",5039

7:1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would
not go about in Judea, because the Jews[35] were
seeking to kill him. 2Now the Jews' Feast of Booths
was at hand. 3So his brothers[36] said to him, “Leave
here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may
see the works you are doing. 4For no one works in
secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do
these things, show yourself to the world.” 5For not
even his brothers believed in him. 6Jesus said to
them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is
always here. 7The world cannot hate you, but it hates
me because I testify about it that its works are evil.
8You go up to the feast. I am not[37] going up to this
feast, for my time has not yet fully come.” 9After
saying this, he remained in Galilee.
10But after his brothers had gone up to the feast,
then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
11The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and
saying, “Where is he?” 12And there was much",5040

muttering about him among the people. While some
said, “He is a good man,” others said, “No, he is
leading the people astray.” 13Yet for fear of the Jews
no one spoke openly of him.
14About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into
the temple and began teaching. 15The Jews
therefore marveled, saying, “How is it that this man
has learning,[38] when he has never studied?” 16So
Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but
his who sent me. 17If anyone's will is to do God's[39]
will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or
whether I am speaking on my own authority. 18The
one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own
glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who
sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.
19Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you
keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?” 20The
crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is
seeking to kill you?” 21Jesus answered them, “I did
one work, and you all marvel at it. 22Moses gave you
circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the",5041
ESV Bible.pdf,"fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
23If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so
that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you
angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a
man's whole body well? 24Do not judge by
appearances, but judge with right judgment.”",5042

25Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said,
“Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? 26And
here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to
him! Can it be that the authorities really know that
this is the Christ? 27But we know where this man
comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one
will know where he comes from.” 28So Jesus
proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, “You know
me, and you know where I come from? But I have not
come of my own accord. He who sent me is true,
and him you do not know. 29I know him, for I come
from him, and he sent me.” 30So they were seeking
to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him,

the people believed in him. They said, “When the
Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man
has done?”",5043

32The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these
things about him, and the chief priests and
Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. 33Jesus then
said, “I will be with you a little longer, and then I am
going to him who sent me. 34You will seek me and
you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.”
35The Jews said to one another, “Where does this
man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he
intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks

as[40] the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will
flow rivers of living water.’” 39Now this he said about

40When they heard these words, some of the people
said, “This really is the Prophet.” 41Others said, “This
is the Christ.” But some said, “Is the Christ to come
from Galilee? 42Has not the Scripture said that the
Christ comes from the offspring of David, and
comes from Bethlehem, the village where David
was?” 43So there was a division among the people
over him. 44Some of them wanted to arrest him, but
no one laid hands on him.
45The officers then came to the chief priests and
Pharisees, who said to them, “Why did you not bring
him?” 46The officers answered, “No one ever spoke
like this man!” 47The Pharisees answered them,
“Have you also been deceived? 48Have any of the
authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? 49But
this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.”
50Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who
was one of them, said to them, 51“Does our law
judge a man without first giving him a hearing and",5046

53[[They went each to his own house, 8:1 but Jesus
went to the Mount of Olives. 2Early in the morning he
came again to the temple. All the people came to
him, and he sat down and taught them. 3The scribes
and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been
caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst 4they
said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught
in the act of adultery. 5Now in the Law Moses
commanded us to stone such women. So what do
you say?” 6This they said to test him, that they might
have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent
down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7And
as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said
to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be
the first to throw a stone at her.” 8And once more he
bent down and wrote on the ground. 9But when they
heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with
the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the
woman standing before him. 10Jesus stood up and
said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one",5048

12Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light
of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in
darkness, but will have the light of life.” 13So the
Pharisees said to him, “You are bearing witness
about yourself; your testimony is not true.” 14Jesus
answered, “Even if I do bear witness about myself,
my testimony is true, for I know where I came from
and where I am going, but you do not know where I
come from or where I am going. 15You judge
according to the flesh; I judge no one. 16Yet even if I
do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who
judge, but I and the Father[42] who sent me. 17In your
Law it is written that the testimony of two people is
true. 18I am the one who bears witness about myself,
and the Father who sent me bears witness about
me.” 19They said to him therefore, “Where is your
Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor
my Father. If you knew me, you would know my
Father also.” 20These words he spoke in the
treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one",5050

21So he said to them again, “I am going away, and
you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I
am going, you cannot come.” 22So the Jews said,
“Will he kill himself, since he says, ‘Where I am
going, you cannot come’?” 23He said to them, “You
are from below; I am from above. You are of this
world; I am not of this world. 24I told you that you
would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I
am he you will die in your sins.” 25So they said to
him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Just what I
have been telling you from the beginning. 26I have
much to say about you and much to judge, but he
who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I

offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved
to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become

34Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you,

slave does not remain in the house forever; the son
remains forever. 36So if the Son sets you free, you

9:1 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
2And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned,
this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
3Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or
his parents, but that the works of God might be
displayed in him. 4We must work the works of him
who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no
one can work. 5As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world.” 6Having said these things, he spat
on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then
he anointed the man's eyes with the mud 7and said
to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which
means Sent). So he went and washed and came
back seeing.
8The neighbors and those who had seen him before
as a beggar were saying, “Is this not the man who
used to sit and beg?” 9Some said, “It is he.” Others
said, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am
the man.” 10So they said to him, “Then how were",5058
ESV Bible.pdf,"your eyes opened?” 11He answered, “The man
called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and
said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went and
washed and received my sight.” 12They said to him,
“Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”
13They brought to the Pharisees the man who had
formerly been blind. 14Now it was a Sabbath day
when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
15So the Pharisees again asked him how he had
received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud
on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 16Some of the
Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he
does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How
can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And
there was a division among them. 17So they said
again to the blind man, “What do you say about him,
since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a
prophet.”
18The Jews did not believe that he had been blind
and had received his sight, until they called the",5059
ESV Bible.pdf,"parents of the man who had received his sight 19and
asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born
blind? How then does he now see?” 20His parents
answered, “We know that this is our son and that he
was born blind. 21But how he now sees we do not
know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask
him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” 22(His
parents said these things because they feared the
Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone
should confess Jesus[46] to be Christ, he was to be
put out of the synagogue.) 23Therefore his parents
said, “He is of age; ask him.”
24So for the second time they called the man who
had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God.
We know that this man is a sinner.” 25He answered,
“Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do
know, that though I was blind, now I see.” 26They said
to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open
your eyes?” 27He answered them, “I have told you
already, and you would not listen. Why do you want
to hear it again? Do you also want to become his",5060

his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. 29We
know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this
man, we do not know where he comes from.” 30The
man answered, “Why, this is an amazing thing! You
do not know where he comes from, and yet he
opened my eyes. 31We know that God does not
listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God
and does his will, God listens to him. 32Never since
the world began has it been heard that anyone
opened the eyes of a man born blind. 33If this man
were not from God, he could do nothing.” 34They
answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would
you teach us?” And they cast him out.
35Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having
found him he said, “Do you believe in the Son of
Man?”[47] 36He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I
may believe in him?” 37Jesus said to him, “You have
seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.” 38He
said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
39Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world,",5061
ESV Bible.pdf,"that those who do not see may see, and those who
see may become blind.” 40Some of the Pharisees
near him heard these things, and said to him, “Are

10:1 “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter
the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another
way, that man is a thief and a robber. 2But he who
enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3To
him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his
voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and
leads them out. 4When he has brought out all his
own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him,
for they know his voice. 5A stranger they will not
follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not
know the voice of strangers.” 6This figure of speech
Jesus used with them, but they did not understand
what he was saying to them.
7So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to
you, I am the door of the sheep. 8All who came
before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
did not listen to them. 9I am the door. If anyone
enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out
and find pasture. 10The thief comes only to steal and",5063

have it abundantly. 11I am the good shepherd. The
good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12He
who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does
not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves
the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and
scatters them. 13He flees because he is a hired
hand and cares nothing for the sheep. 14I am the
good shepherd. I know my own and my own know
me, 15just as the Father knows me and I know the
Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16And I
have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring
them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there
will be one flock, one shepherd. 17For this reason
the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I
may take it up again. 18No one takes it from me, but I
lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it
down, and I have authority to take it up again. This
charge I have received from my Father.”
19There was again a division among the Jews
because of these words. 20Many of them said, “He",5064

long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the
Christ, tell us plainly.” 25Jesus answered them, “I told
you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in
my Father's name bear witness about me, 26but you

greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them
out of the Father's hand. 30I and the Father are one.”

you going to stone me?” 33The Jews answered him,",5066

5Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus. 6So, when he heard that Lazarus[50] was ill,
he stayed two days longer in the place where he
was. 7Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us
go to Judea again.” 8The disciples said to him,
“Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone
you, and are you going there again?” 9Jesus
answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If
anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble,
because he sees the light of this world. 10But if",5069

light is not in him.” 11After saying these things, he
said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
but I go to awaken him.” 12The disciples said to him,
“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” 13Now
Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that
he meant taking rest in sleep. 14Then Jesus told
them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15and for your sake I
am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe.
But let us go to him.” 16So Thomas, called the
Twin,[51] said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go,
that we may die with him.”",5070

already been in the tomb four days. 18Bethany was
near Jerusalem, about two miles[52] off, 19and many
of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to
console them concerning their brother. 20So when
Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and
met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.
21Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here,
my brother would not have died. 22But even now I
know that whatever you ask from God, God will give
you.” 23Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise
again.” 24Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise
again in the resurrection on the last day.” 25Jesus
said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life.[53]

live, 26and everyone who lives and believes in me

been here, my brother would not have died.” 33When

come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved
in his spirit and greatly troubled. 34And he said,
“Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord,

into his hands, and that he had come from God and
was going back to God, 4rose from supper. He laid
aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it
around his waist. 5Then he poured water into a basin
and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe
them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
6He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord,
do you wash my feet?” 7Jesus answered him, “What
I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward
you will understand.” 8Peter said to him, “You shall
never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not
wash you, you have no share with me.” 9Simon Peter

who has bathed does not need to wash, except for
his feet,[59] but is completely clean. And you[60] are
clean, but not every one of you.” 11For he knew who
was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of
you are clean.”

glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I
had with you before the world existed.

you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and
you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
7Now they know that everything that you have given

Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you
have given me, that they may be one, even as we
are one. 12While I was with them, I kept them in your
name, which you have given me. I have guarded
them, and not one of them has been lost except the
son of destruction, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled. 13But now I am coming to you, and these

fulfilled in themselves. 14I have given them your word,

of the world, just as I am not of the world. 15I do not
ask that you take them out of the world, but that you
keep them from the evil one.[75] 16They are not of the
world, just as I am not of the world. 17Sanctify
them[76] in the truth; your word is truth. 18As you sent

his disciples. 3So Judas, having procured a band of

were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him

19:1 Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. 2And
the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and
put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.
3They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the
Jews!” and struck him with their hands. 4Pilate went
out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him
out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in

thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them,
“Behold the man!” 6When the chief priests and the
officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify
him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and
crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.” 7The Jews
answered him, “We have a law, and according to
that law he ought to die because he has made
himself the Son of God.” 8When Pilate heard this
statement, he was even more afraid. 9He entered his
headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are
you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. 10So
Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you",5120

authority to crucify you?” 11Jesus answered him,
“You would have no authority over me at all unless it
had been given you from above. Therefore he who
delivered me over to you has the greater sin.”
12From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the
Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not
Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king
opposes Caesar.” 13So when Pilate heard these
words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the
judgment seat at a place called The Stone
Pavement, and in Aramaic[85] Gabbatha. 14Now it
was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was
about the sixth hour.[86] He said to the Jews, “Behold
your King!” 15They cried out, “Away with him, away
with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I
crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We
have no king but Caesar.” 16So he delivered him
over to them to be crucified.",5121

So they took Jesus, 17and he went out, bearing his
own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull,
which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. 18There they
crucified him, and with him two others, one on either
side, and Jesus between them. 19Pilate also wrote
an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus
of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” 20Many of the
Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus
was crucified was near the city, and it was written in
Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. 21So the chief
priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The
King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am
King of the Jews.’” 22Pilate answered, “What I have
written I have written.”
23When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took
his garments and divided them into four parts, one
part for each soldier; also his tunic.[87] But the tunic
was seamless, woven in one piece from top to
bottom, 24so they said to one another, “Let us not",5122

This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,
“They divided my garments among them,
and for my clothing they cast lots.”
So the soldiers did these things, 25but standing by
the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Magdalene. 26When Jesus saw his mother and the
disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to
his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” 27Then he
said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from
that hour the disciple took her to his own home.",5123

and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who
had been crucified with him. 33But when they came
to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did
not break his legs. 34But one of the soldiers pierced
his side with a spear, and at once there came out
blood and water. 35He who saw it has borne witness
—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is

earlier had come to Jesus[88] by night, came
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-
five pounds[89] in weight. 40So they took the body of
