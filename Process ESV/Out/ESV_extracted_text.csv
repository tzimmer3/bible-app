ESV Bible.pdf,"The Creation of the World
1:1 In the beginning, God created the heavens and
the earth. 2The earth was without form and void, and
darkness was over the face of the deep. And the
Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the
waters.
3And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was
light. 4And God saw that the light was good. And
God separated the light from the darkness. 5God
called the light Day, and the darkness he called
Night. And there was evening and there was
morning, the first day.
6And God said, “Let there be an expanse[1] in the
midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters
from the waters.” 7And God made[2] the expanse
and separated the waters that were under the
expanse from the waters that were above the
expanse. And it was so. 8And God called the
expanse Heaven.[3] And there was evening and",40
ESV Bible.pdf,"there was morning, the second day.
9And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens
be gathered together into one place, and let the dry
land appear.” And it was so. 10God called the dry
land Earth,[4] and the waters that were gathered
together he called Seas. And God saw that it was
good.
11And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation,
plants[5] yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in
which is their seed, each according to its kind, on
the earth.” And it was so. 12The earth brought forth
vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their
own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their
seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that
it was good. 13And there was evening and there was
morning, the third day.
14And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse
of the heavens to separate the day from the night.
And let them be for signs and for seasons,[6] and for
days and years, 15and let them be lights in the",41
ESV Bible.pdf,"expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.”
And it was so. 16And God made the two great lights
—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light
to rule the night—and the stars. 17And God set them
in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the
earth, 18to rule over the day and over the night, and
to separate the light from the darkness. And God
saw that it was good. 19And there was evening and
there was morning, the fourth day.
20And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms
of living creatures, and let birds[7] fly above the earth
across the expanse of the heavens.” 21So God
created the great sea creatures and every living
creature that moves, with which the waters swarm,
according to their kinds, and every winged bird
according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
22And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and
multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds
multiply on the earth.” 23And there was evening and
there was morning, the fifth day.",42
ESV Bible.pdf,"24And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living
creatures according to their kinds—livestock and
creeping things and beasts of the earth according to
their kinds.” And it was so. 25And God made the
beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the
livestock according to their kinds, and everything that
creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God
saw that it was good.
26Then God said, “Let us make man[8] in our image,
after our likeness. And let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens
and over the livestock and over all the earth and over
every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
27So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God he created him;
male and female he created them.
28And God blessed them. And God said to them,
“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue
it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and
over the birds of the heavens and over every living",43
ESV Bible.pdf,"thing that moves on the earth.” 29And God said,
“Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed
that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with
seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. 30And
to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the
heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth,
everything that has the breath of life, I have given
every green plant for food.” And it was so. 31And
God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it
was very good. And there was evening and there
was morning, the sixth day.",44
ESV Bible.pdf,"The Seventh Day, God Rests
2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the host of them. 2And on the seventh day
God finished his work that he had done, and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work that he
had done. 3So God blessed the seventh day and
made it holy, because on it God rested from all his
work that he had done in creation.",45
ESV Bible.pdf,"The Creation of Man and Woman
4These are the generations
of the heavens and the earth when they were
created,
in the day that the LORD God made the earth and
the heavens.
5When no bush of the field[9] was yet in the land[10]
and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for
the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land,
and there was no man to work the ground, 6and a
mist[11] was going up from the land and was
watering the whole face of the ground— 7then the
LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and
the man became a living creature. 8And the LORD
God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there
he put the man whom he had formed. 9And out of the
ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree
that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The
tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil.",46
ESV Bible.pdf,"10A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and
there it divided and became four rivers. 11The name
of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed
around the whole land of Havilah, where there is
gold. 12And the gold of that land is good; bdellium
and onyx stone are there. 13The name of the second
river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the
whole land of Cush. 14And the name of the third river
is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the
fourth river is the Euphrates.
15The LORD God took the man and put him in the
garden of Eden to work it and keep it. 16And the
LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may
surely eat of every tree of the garden, 17but of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not
eat, for in the day that you eat[12] of it you shall surely
die.”
18Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the
man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit",47
ESV Bible.pdf,"for[13] him.” 19Now out of the ground the LORD God
had formed[14] every beast of the field and every bird
of the heavens and brought them to the man to see
what he would call them. And whatever the man
called every living creature, that was its name. 20The
man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of
the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for
Adam[15] there was not found a helper fit for him.
21So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall
upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs
and closed up its place with flesh. 22And the rib that
the LORD God had taken from the man he made[16]
into a woman and brought her to the man. 23Then the
man said,
“This at last is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of Man.”[17]
24Therefore a man shall leave his father and his
mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall",48

both naked and were not ashamed.",49
ESV Bible.pdf,"The Fall
3:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other
beast of the field that the LORD God had made.
He said to the woman, “Did God actually say,
‘You[18] shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”
2And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of
the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3but God said,
‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the
midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest
you die.’” 4But the serpent said to the woman, “You
will not surely die. 5For God knows that when you eat
of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like
God, knowing good and evil.” 6So when the woman
saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a
delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be
desired to make one wise,[19] she took of its fruit and
ate, and she also gave some to her husband who
was with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both
were opened, and they knew that they were naked.
And they sewed fig leaves together and made",50
ESV Bible.pdf,"themselves loincloths.
8And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking
in the garden in the cool[20] of the day, and the man
and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the
LORD God among the trees of the garden. 9But the
LORD God called to the man and said to him,
“Where are you?”[21] 10And he said, “I heard the
sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid,
because I was naked, and I hid myself.” 11He said,
“Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten
of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
12The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be
with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”
13Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is
this that you have done?” The woman said, “The
serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
14The LORD God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this,
cursed are you above all livestock
and above all beasts of the field;",51

and dust you shall eat
all the days of your life.
15I will put enmity between you and the woman,

16To the woman he said,
“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing;
in pain you shall bring forth children.
Your desire shall be for[23] your husband,
and he shall rule over you.”
17And to Adam he said,
“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife

20The man called his wife's name Eve, because she
was the mother of all living.[24] 21And the LORD God
made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins
and clothed them.
22Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has
become like one of us in knowing good and evil.
Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the
tree of life and eat, and live forever—” 23therefore
the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden

4:1 Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she
conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten[25] a
man with the help of the LORD.” 2And again, she
bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of
sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground. 3In the
course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering
of the fruit of the ground, 4and Abel also brought of
the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And
the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, 5but
for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain
was very angry, and his face fell. 6The LORD said to
Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face
fallen? 7If you do well, will you not be accepted?[26]
And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the
door. Its desire is for[27] you, but you must rule over
it.”
8Cain spoke to Abel his brother.[28] And when they
were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother
Abel and killed him. 9Then the LORD said to Cain,",55

know; am I my brother's keeper?” 10And the LORD
said, “What have you done? The voice of your
brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.

has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood
from your hand. 12When you work the ground, it shall
no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a
fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” 13Cain said to
the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can
bear.[29] 14Behold, you have driven me today away
from the ground, and from your face I shall be
hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the
earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” 15Then the
LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the
LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him
should attack him. 16Then Cain went away from the
presence of the LORD and settled in the land of

heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground
and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are
delivered. 3Every moving thing that lives shall be
food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I",72
ESV Bible.pdf,"give you everything. 4But you shall not eat flesh with
its life, that is, its blood. 5And for your lifeblood I will
require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it
and from man. From his fellow man I will require a
reckoning for the life of man.
6“Whoever sheds the blood of man,
by man shall his blood be shed,
for God made man in his own image.
7And you,[47] be fruitful and multiply, teem on the
earth and multiply in it.”
8Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
9“Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your
offspring after you, 10and with every living creature
that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every
beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of
the ark; it is for every beast of the earth. 11I establish
my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh
be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again
shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” 12And
God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I",73
ESV Bible.pdf,"make between me and you and every living creature
that is with you, for all future generations: 13I have set
my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the
covenant between me and the earth. 14When I bring
clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the
clouds, 15I will remember my covenant that is
between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh. And the waters shall never again become a
flood to destroy all flesh. 16When the bow is in the
clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting
covenant between God and every living creature of
all flesh that is on the earth.” 17God said to Noah,
“This is the sign of the covenant that I have
established between me and all flesh that is on the
earth.”",74
ESV Bible.pdf,"Noah's Descendants
18The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were
Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of
Canaan.) 19These three were the sons of Noah, and
from these the people of the whole earth were
dispersed.[48]
20Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he
planted a vineyard.[49] 21He drank of the wine and
became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent. 22And
Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of
his father and told his two brothers outside. 23Then
Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both
their shoulders, and walked backward and covered
the nakedness of their father. Their faces were
turned backward, and they did not see their father's
nakedness. 24When Noah awoke from his wine and
knew what his youngest son had done to him, 25he
said,
“Cursed be Canaan;",75
ESV Bible.pdf,"a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”
26He also said,
“Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem;
and let Canaan be his servant.
27May God enlarge Japheth,[50]
and let him dwell in the tents of Shem,
and let Canaan be his servant.”

10:1 These are the generations of the sons of
Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to
them after the flood.
2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai,
Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 3The sons of
Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4The
sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and
Dodanim. 5From these the coastland peoples
spread in their lands, each with his own language, by
their clans, in their nations.
6The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
7The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah,
and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and
Dedan. 8Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on
earth to be a mighty man.[51] 9He was a mighty
hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, “Like
Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.” 10The
beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad,",77

he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir,
Calah, and 12Resen between Nineveh and Calah;
that is the great city. 13Egypt fathered Ludim,
Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 14Pathrusim,
Casluhim (from whom[52] the Philistines came), and
Caphtorim.
15Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth,

17the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 18the
Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.

19And the territory of the Canaanites extended from
Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in
the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and
Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 20These are the sons of

Shelah fathered Eber. 25To Eber were born two
sons: the name of the one was Peleg,[53] for in his
days the earth was divided, and his brother's name
was Joktan. 26Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph,
Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

11:1 Now the whole earth had one language and
the same words. 2And as people migrated from the
east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and
settled there. 3And they said to one another, “Come,
let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And
they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
4Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city
and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us
make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed
over the face of the whole earth.” 5And the LORD
came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of man had built. 6And the LORD said,
“Behold, they are one people, and they have all one
language, and this is only the beginning of what they
will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now
be impossible for them. 7Come, let us go down and
there confuse their language, so that they may not
understand one another's speech.” 8So the LORD
dispersed them from there over the face of all the
earth, and they left off building the city. 9Therefore its",80
